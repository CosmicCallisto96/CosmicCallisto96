I'm a young Developer with a knack for Coding and UI/UX design.I am extremely driven, with a clear goal to succeed.I am committed to learning and self-development so that I can consistently achieve better results.The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me. I have a wide range of skills that include back-end development using open source technologies (NodeJs), design (working closely with designers), front-end development (React, ReactJs,ReactNative, HTML5, CSS,SCSS, Javascript, Responsive, UI/UX),database(MongoDB,Mysql).
